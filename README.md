# Arduino IDE

1. Find out which Arduino you are using or to which Arduino your microcontroller is compatible to
2. [Use the instructions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) provided for your model to configure Arduino IDE
3. Have fun! 

# Helper

## Convert decimal to hex

If your decimal is *34*, you can convert it into hex in the terminal by using:

```
echo "obase=16; 34" | bc
```

# MacOS

## Find the USB device

```
ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l
```

This will list all USB devices, for example:
